Twitterfeed for the codestar website.


## Running
To test it locally make sure to have the following environment variables before running `sbt`.

- **TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY**: The consumer key supplied by Twitter
- **TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET**: The consumer secret supplied by Twitter.

```bash
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRT
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=abc123def456asdf
```

As with all Play applications, start it with `run` inside the `sbt`-shell.
